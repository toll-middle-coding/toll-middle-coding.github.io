 <h1> Merry Christmas</h1> 
  <p>What will you be doing for your xmas? I will be at my grandparents in Arizona. I should see most of my family there and I will get to mess around and hang with my family.</p>
<h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>I will be at my house and my cousin may come over but that is probably all the the family that is coming. Other than that we will just eat alot and stuff.</p>
